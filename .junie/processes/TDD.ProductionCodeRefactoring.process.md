# TDD Production Code Refactoring Process

STARTER_CHARACTER = 🟣

-🟣 I understand the TDD production code refactoring process. I'm ready to help refactor your code following these steps:
1. Confirm test file location
2. Ensure tests pass
3. Make simple, atomic refactorings
4. Verify tests after each change
5. Commit with "♻️" emoji.
6. Provide status updates

Please share the code you'd like me to refactor, and I'll start by confirming the relevant test file location.
